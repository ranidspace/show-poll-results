# Tumblr Poll Result viewer
Allows you to see the results of polls before voting in them, with a small button

This is a heavily stripped down version of dashboard-unfucker, though it appends a button to each post to view the results instead of showing them all the time

## Installation
The script works with and is fully tested with Violentmonkey, but should work with most others userscript engines.
- Install any one of the script injector extensions listed above.
- Click on [pollviewer.user.js](https://github.com/ranidspace/show-poll-results/raw/main/pollviewer.user.js) to install or update.
- NOTE: if you are updating from a version that ends in "b" (the no-flags version), the script will be installed separately instead of overwriting the existing script because they have different `@name` properties. You should disable or delete the old version of the script, as having both enabled will cause unintended behaviour.
